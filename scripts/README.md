# Code and Analysis

In order to make things easier to find, and prevent naming clashes - as there will be many people working on this project - **please** do the following:

1. Create a folder unique to yourself (for example, named with your GitHub username, e.g., `eyelverton`).
2. Put any and all code in it - finished or unfinished, we want it all!
3. Make your filenames as descriptive as you can (for example, `nyc_brooklyn_evictions_regression.R` is _far preferable_ to simply `analysis.R` or `regression.R`).

Thank you very much!
